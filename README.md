# Rooster Grin Media - Front-End Developer Test

## Description

This project was to create a client website (in this case, Rooster Grin) to resemble the provided mockup (design freedom was given in using the assets provided).

## Technology

The technologies used in this project included:

  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - Bootstrap

I chose to use the Bootstrap framework, as it would allow me to address the design and technical requirements of the project including using a grid system, implementing a carousel, and ensuring responsive design.

CSS was utilized to create the animations throughout the page:

  1. Animated logo alternating between white and color
  2. Fade in effect of the hero title
  3. Color switch on hover of the circles of the 4 icons
  4. Change in color and size on hover of the social media icons

## Challenges

One of the main challenges of this project was figuring out which particular element to style, how to style it, and styling it just right for it to look good, work with the layout, and match what the mockup was going for. I did spend a lot of time working on the responsive design and media queries as well as the CSS and animations. An example is the circles around the 4 icons. I initially started with trying to style the icons but then figured out I had to style the "li" they were in.

## Impression

Overall, I enjoyed the challenge of this project and was able to learn and use some new techniques, such as the use of SVG icons and creating new CSS animations I had not done before in previous projects. It was also a good opportunity to incorporate Bootstrap in this project.
